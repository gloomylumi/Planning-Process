        What is the purpose of this site?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thefigleaffurniture.com will become the primary mode of advertising for The Fig Leaf Furniture storefront (via promotional avenues like Yelp and GoogleAdWords). The site should serve as a visual representation of—as well as an invitation to—our store. Through strategic use of color and texture, we want to create an experience that is evocative of the cozy feeling of being at home. Quality product images and a layout that effectively showcases is critical to a successful design. Ultimately, the site should elicit a curiosity that can only be fulfilled by coming into the store for a tactile experience.
